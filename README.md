## Files
- `Shawon_Thread.java` - source code (single class)
- `run_all.sh` - runs all test cases (safe once, unsafe 5 times each)
- `outputs/all_outputs.txt` - raw program output
- `handwritten/` - scans/photos of the handwritten code and output screenshots (add yours here)

## How to run
```bash
javac Shawon_Thread.java
java Shawon_Thread 10 100000 true    # thread-safe (AtomicLong)
java Shawon_Thread 10 100000 false   # unsynchronized
```

            if (threadSafe)
                safeStatic.incrementAndGet();
            else
                unsafeStatic++;

> Percentage difference = |static - non-static| / non-static x 100

All outputs above are real, unedited program output from running run_all.sh (Java 21). They were produced on a machine with 1 CPU core; with a single core threads rarely overlap, so many unsafe runs showed no loss. On a multi-core computer the losses are usually larger and more frequent.

## Observation and Conclusion
Static vs non-static describes **ownership**, not thread-safety. With AtomicLong, the static counter matched the non-static total in all 7 test cases (0% difference). With a plain static long, lost updates appeared in some runs (TC4: up to 34.23%, TC6: up to 11.52%) while other runs of the same test lost nothing. The difference is **not monotonic** in the thread count: it depends on thread scheduling, number of CPU cores and the JVM's runtime optimisation. The non-static total was always exactly n x m because each thread owns its counter.

## Analysis questions
**1. What is the difference between a static and a non-static variable in Java?**

A static variable belongs to the class: only one copy exists, shared by every object. A non-static (instance) variable belongs to one object: every object gets its own copy.

**2. Why do all threads share the same static counter?**

The static field is stored once per class, not per object. Every thread runs the same class code, so all of them read and write the same memory location.

**3. Why does each thread have its own non-static counter?**

Each thread is given its own Shawon_Thread object (created with `new`), and each object has its own `instanceCount`. No other thread ever touches it, so there is no race.

**4. Why is join() required before calculating the final counts?**

start() returns immediately and the thread runs in the background. Without join(), main could read the counters while threads are still running and get partial values. join() makes main wait until every thread finishes.

**5. Why can the unsynchronized static count be lower than expected?**

`unsafeStatic++` is not one step; it is read, add 1, write back. If two threads read the same old value, both write old+1, and one increment is lost (lost update). Many such overlaps make the final value lower than n x m.

**6. Does increasing the number of threads always increase the percentage difference?**

No. In my runs the loss appeared for 10 threads (avg 12.19%) and 50 threads (avg 5.85%), but not for 20 or 100 threads. More threads only give more `chance` for overlap; the real loss depends on scheduling, CPU cores and JIT optimisation, so it is not monotonic.

**7. Why might two runs with the same number of threads produce different results?**

The OS scheduler decides when each thread runs and when it is paused. The interleaving of the read-modify-write steps differs in every run, so the number of lost updates differs (e.g. TC4: 0%, 26.74%, 34.23%).

**8. What changes when AtomicLong is used instead of a regular long?**

AtomicLong.incrementAndGet() performs the read-modify-write as one indivisible (atomic) operation using hardware compare-and-set, so no update is lost. Static count always equals non-static total and the difference is 0%.

**9. How can all threads share one instance counter as well as the static counter?**

Create a single object and pass the same object to every Thread: `Shawon_Thread shared = new Shawon_Thread(); new Thread(shared)` for all n threads. Then the instance counter is shared too, so it also needs synchronization (a synchronized method or AtomicLong).
